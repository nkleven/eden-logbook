DEPLOYMENT PATHS (Choose One)
================================================================================

OPTION A: Azure Static Web Apps (RECOMMENDED)
   Time: 15 minutes
   Cost: ~$15/month + storage
   Command: 
   $ az staticwebapp create --name project-eden --resource-group <rg> \
     --source https://github.com/your-org/eden-beta --branch main

OPTION B: Azure App Service
   Time: 20 minutes
   Cost: ~$50-500/month (depends on tier)
   Command:
   $ az appservice plan create --name eden-plan --sku B2 --resource-group <rg>
   $ az webapp create --resource-group <rg> --plan eden-plan --name eden

OPTION C: Azure Container Instances
   Time: 25 minutes
   Cost: Pay-per-second (~$1-10/day)
   Command:
   $ docker build -t project-eden:2.0.10.0 .
   $ az container create --image <acr>/project-eden:2.0.10.0 ...

================================================================================

PRE-DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

Azure Resources (Must Create First):
   [ ] Azure Subscription with owner access
   [ ] Resource Group
   [ ] Cosmos DB (NoSQL) with databases: eden-inventory
   [ ] Key Vault (Premium tier recommended)
   [ ] Storage Account (product images)
   [ ] Application Insights (optional but recommended)

Third-Party Services:
   [ ] Auth0 Tenant (identity provider)
   [ ] Stripe Account (payment processing)

Secrets to Store in Key Vault:
   - cosmos-key (Cosmos DB primary key)
   - auth0-secret (session encryption, 32+ chars)
   - auth0-client-secret (from Auth0 Dashboard)
   - stripe-secret-key (from Stripe Dashboard)
   - stripe-webhook-secret (from Stripe Dashboard)

Environment Variables:
   - ADMIN_EMAILS (comma-separated email list)
   - AUTH0_BASE_URL (your production domain)
   - COSMOS_ENDPOINT (Cosmos DB endpoint URL)
   - AZURE_KEYVAULT_URL (Key Vault URL)

================================================================================

POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION
================================================================================

Health Checks (Run These):
   $ curl https://your-domain/api/health
   Expected: { "status": "ok", "environment": "production", ... }

   $ curl https://your-domain/
   Expected: 200 OK (landing page loads)

   $ curl https://your-domain/setup
   Expected: 200 OK (setup wizard accessible)

Smoke Tests (Manual):
   1. Navigate to https://your-domain
   2. Click "Sign In" → should redirect to Auth0
   3. Log in with admin email (from ADMIN_EMAILS)
   4. Should land on /inventory or /admin page
   5. Test vendor creation (admin only)
   6. Test product upload (with image)

Monitoring:
   - Application Insights: Check for errors
   - Azure Portal: Monitor CPU, memory, network
   - Log Analytics: Check for warnings/exceptions

Success Criteria:
   ✅ Application loads without errors
   ✅ Auth0 login works end-to-end
   ✅ Admin can create vendors
   ✅ API health endpoint responds
   ✅ Zero errors in telemetry (first 24 hours)

================================================================================

CRITICAL OPERATIONS
================================================================================

Emergency Restart:
   $ az webapp restart --resource-group <rg> --name project-eden

Check Logs:
   $ az webapp log tail --resource-group <rg> --name project-eden

Database Issues:
   - Check Cosmos DB status in Azure Portal
   - Verify Key Vault access for Managed Identity
   - Test connection string from Portal

Auth0 Issues:
   - Verify tenant domain in AUTH0_BASE_URL
   - Check Auth0 Dashboard → Applications
   - Confirm callback URL matches deployment domain

Stripe Issues:
   - Verify webhook endpoint is public & accessible
   - Check signing secret in Key Vault
   - Review Stripe Dashboard → Events

Rollback (If Needed):
   1. Identify last good commit: git log --oneline | head -1
   2. Checkout previous version: git checkout <commit-hash>
   3. Rebuild & redeploy: npm run build && az webapp deployment ...
   4. Verify: curl https://your-domain/api/health
